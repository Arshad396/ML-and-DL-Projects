****Industrial Copper Modeling Project****
This repository contains a comprehensive project focusing on data analysis, machine learning modeling, and the creation of an interactive web application using Python, particularly targeting the manufacturing domain.

**Project Overview**
The objective of this project is to address challenges faced by the copper industry in handling skewed and noisy data related to sales and pricing. The project encompasses two primary machine learning tasks:

**Regression Modeling:** Predicting the 'Selling_Price' using advanced techniques such as data normalization, outlier detection, and regression algorithms.

**Classification Modeling:** Classifying leads as either 'WON' or 'LOST' to assess their likelihood of becoming customers.
Skills Acquired

**This project has been instrumental in gaining proficiency in:**

**Python programming language and its data analysis libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit.
Data preprocessing techniques including handling missing values, outlier detection, and data normalization for machine learning model preparation.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using various visualization techniques such as boxplots, histograms, and scatter plots.
Implementing advanced machine learning techniques for regression and classification tasks.
Building, evaluating, and optimizing machine learning models using appropriate evaluation metrics, cross-validation, and hyperparameter tuning.
Feature engineering methods to enhance data representations.
Developing an interactive web application using the Streamlit module to showcase machine learning models and make predictions on new data.
Project Structure


**Data Understanding and Preprocessing:** Identifying variable types, handling missing values, outlier treatment, and encoding categorical variables.

**EDA:** Visualizing outliers and skewness before and after treatment using Seaborn's plotting functionalities.

**Feature Engineering:** Creating new informative representations of the data.

**Model Building and Evaluation:** Splitting data, training and evaluating regression and classification models, and optimizing model hyperparameters.

**Streamlit GUI:** Creating an interactive web page to predict 'Selling_Price' or 'Status' based on user input.
