********Smart Predictive Modeling for Rental Property Prices********

****Overview****
This repository contains code and resources for a data-driven approach to predicting rental prices for residential properties. The project aims to provide accurate rent predictions based on historical rental data and property attributes. This predictive model benefits property owners, tenants, and property management companies by aiding in setting competitive prices, informed decision-making, and optimizing portfolio management.

****Project Structure****

**Data:** The dataset used for training and testing the predictive models.

**Notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks containing the code for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection/engineering, model selection, training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.

**Models:** Saved models after training and optimization.

**Documentation:** Includes additional documentation, such as project details, methodologies, and insights gained from the analysis.
Technologies and Tools Used
**Python:** Programming language used for data manipulation, analysis, and model development.
**Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis. Scikit-learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow, or other relevant libraries for machine learning modelling.

**Jupyter Notebooks:** Used for exploratory data analysis, code development, and documentation.


****Problem Statement and Dataset****
The project focuses on predicting rental prices for residential properties in the real estate domain. The dataset includes various property attributes such as type, locality, amenities, property size, lease type, and more, aiming to predict the rental price based on these features.

****Dataset Description****
**Features:** Contains various attributes of properties (e.g., type, locality, amenities, size, lease type).
Target Variable: Rental price of the properties.

****Key Tasks****

**Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning, handling missing values, outliers, and encoding categorical variables.

**Feature Selection and Engineering:** Identifying significant features and creating new informative ones.

**Model Selection:** Choosing appropriate regression algorithms and potentially ensembling or stacking models.

**Model Training and Evaluation:** Splitting data, training models, and evaluating performance using relevant metrics.

**Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizing model performance by fine-tuning hyperparameters.

**Interpretability and Explainability:** Analyzing feature importance and explaining their impact on rental prices.

**Deployment:** Deploying the model as a user-friendly web application or API.

****Analysis Insights****
The exploratory data analysis (EDA) provides valuable insights into the factors influencing rental prices, including correlations between property attributes and rent, geospatial analysis, temporal trends, property features, building characteristics, negotiations, amenities, water supply, and predictive analysis.

****Outcome****
The successful implementation of the predictive model will facilitate accurate rental price estimation, benefiting property stakeholders by enhancing transparency, aiding decision-making, and contributing to a more efficient rental market.
